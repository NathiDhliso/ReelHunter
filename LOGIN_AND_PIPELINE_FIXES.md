# ReelHunter Login and Pipeline Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Authentication Issues
- **Problem**: Users were getting stuck on loading spinner after login
- **Root Cause**: Missing profile creation and improper auth state handling
- **Solution**: Enhanced `useAuth` hook to automatically create recruiter profiles

### 2. Pipeline Loading Issues  
- **Problem**: Pipeline page showed infinite loading spinner
- **Root Cause**: Missing error handling and role validation
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive error handling and user role checks

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Authentication Hook (`src/hooks/useAuth.ts`)

**Key Improvements:**
- Added automatic profile creation for new users with `recruiter` role
- Improved session handling with both initial session check and state changes
- Added `accessToken` property for API calls
- Enhanced logging for debugging
- Better error handling for profile operations

### 2. Improved Pipeline Component (`src/components/pipeline/DragDropPipeline.tsx`)

**Key Improvements:**
- Added comprehensive error states with retry functionality
- Enhanced loading states with proper messaging
- Added role-based access control (recruiter-only access)
- Better error messages for different failure scenarios

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Authentication Testing
1. Go to ReelHunter app
2. Click anywhere to trigger login modal
3. Sign up with new email/password or login with existing credentials
4. Profile should be created automatically as recruiter
5. Should redirect to pipeline without infinite loading

### 2. Pipeline Testing
1. **Empty Pipeline**: New recruiters see empty pipeline with default stages
2. **Error Handling**: Network issues show proper error with retry button
3. **Loading States**: Professional loading spinner with descriptive text

## Console Logging Added

The fixes include comprehensive console logging for debugging:

```javascript
// Auth debugging
[Auth] Getting initial session...
[Auth] User authenticated, checking/creating profile...
[Auth] Profile created successfully

// Pipeline debugging  
DragDropPipeline - Auth state: {isAuthenticated, userId, authLoading}
DragDropPipeline - Loading pipeline data for authenticated user
DragDropPipeline - Pipeline data loaded: X stages
```

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the ReelHunter directory:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Still seeing loading spinner:**
   - Check browser console for error messages
   - Verify environment variables are set
   - Check Supabase connection

2. **Access denied error:**
   - User profile might not have `recruiter` role
   - Check profiles table in Supabase dashboard

3. **No pipeline stages:**
   - Database trigger should create default stages automatically

The fixes ensure a smooth authentication flow and reliable pipeline functionality for ReelHunter recruiters.
